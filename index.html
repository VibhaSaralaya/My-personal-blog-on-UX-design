  			<hr >

  			<h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize" >Design thinking is a non-linear and iterative process means the results of one stage may require you to return to the previous stages again.</h5>

  			<p class="text-muted text-left" >It is a 5-step process that is applied for problem-solving. This method emphasizes user needs and behavior so that we can build products which can help and change the lives of people. We should have empathy towards the user during the overall process to understand the goals, needs, and pain points of the ideal user. Design Thinking is an iterative process involving redefining problems, empathizing users, ideating solutions. Design thinking process involves 5 phases —<i><b>Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test</i></b>.</p>

  			<h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>1. Empathise</kbd></h4>
  			
  			<hr >

  			<h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize" >Empathy means the ability to understand the feelings of others, their experiences, and motivations. This phase involves understanding the user deeply. </h5>

  			<p class="text-muted text-left" >The typical activities performed during this phase are:-<br>

          1) <b>Observation</b> — You spend time with real users and observe their activities, engage with them. How do they interact with the existing product? What are the problems faced by them?
          <br>2)<b> User-Interviews </b>— You perform one on one or group interviews with the real users. This interview aims at collecting qualitative data related to users. How do they interact? How do they feel about using the product? What are the pain points with the current product?
          <br> 3) <b>User Surveys </b>— User Surveys collect qualitative and quantitative data about the target audience. We mostly conducted these surveys online to capture their interactions and experiences with a digital product/service.
          <br> 4) <b>Empathy Mapping </b>— This tool is mostly to gather all the important insights of user research in one place. Empathy maps include what people do, feel, say, hear in relation to a product.</p>

  			<hr >

  			<h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize" >Collecting all the gatherings of empathizing phase, the next phase is defining the problem</h5>

  			<p class="text-muted text-left" >This is the second step of design phase which gives opportunity to analyze all the observations, identify the similar patterns in the gathered findings, and start placing them together. This will lead you to find the Problem Statement. Problem Statement or POV (Point of View) Statement is a concise description of the major problem or issue to be solved.

        We should not define the problem statement as per business goals. At the end of this phase, you will get a simple <b>problem statement</b>, which will be the basis for the next steps in the design thinking process. The activities performed during this phase are:-
        
       <br> 1) <b>Clustering </b>-This task involves finding and grouping prominent and similar patterns in data. This phase involves brainstorming.
        <br>2) <b>User Personas</b> -A persona is an archetype that is used in empathizing with users’ needs and problems. This helps to define the problem statement in a human-centered way.</p>

  			<hr >

  			<h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize" >After defining the problem, the next step is to ideate solutions or ideas for the problem.</h5>

  			<p class="text-muted text-left" >In this phase, we try to brainstorm ideas as much as possible. This is a transition phase from identifying problems to exploring solutions. Then the collected ideas are evaluated by the entire team; Everyone has the full freedom to think up to a bigger picture and explore the ideas as much as possible. The team decides what they are going to prototype in the next phase. It is good to have many ideas at the beginning itself. You can pick ideation techniques to test your ideas at the end of this phase. The different Ideation techniques are:-

          <br>1) <b>Brainstorming</b> -This technique is a group activity performed by all the team members to find the conclusion or solution to a specific user problem.Some of the most useful strategies are "How Might We" and "Crazy Eights" All the team members generate ideas.
          <br> 2) <b>Worst Possible Idea</b>-This technique is a fun activity in which the worst solution among ideated ideas.</p>

  			<hr >

  			<h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize" >This is an experimental phase in which we turn ideas into something tangible to find solutions for specific problems and to test on real users.</h5>

  			<p class="text-muted text-left" >Prototyping allows us to test our ideas quickly and update and text them on time. This phase involves building scaled-down versions of the entire product or some specific features of the product to test. A prototype allows us to know what features work and what does not. Prototyping can be a simple paper model or a digital interactive model. It can be low-fidelity or high-fidelity. You can start with written wireframe and then digital low-fidelity wireframe and prototyping, as it is easy to make changes. Prototyping is an iterative path, and they are updated and improved as per users’ feedback in the testing phase. We may share these prototypes with anybody inside or outside the design team. Prototypes are accepted, rejected, improved as per users’ feedback.

          Paper Prototyping is a major technique performed during this phase:- Paper Prototyping is a process involving the paper presentation of the ideated solution or a digital product. They are low-cost, flexible, and can be easily updated. Paper Prototyping helps in realizing design possibilities and concepts and test designs.This is followed by designing the Mockup and the final interative high fidelity prototype.</p>

  			<hr >

  			<h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize" >During this stage you discover whether your idea(s) solves the user problem uncovered during the Empathise stage.</h5>

  			<p class="text-muted text-left" >The last phase of Design Thinking process is the Testing phase. The designers evaluate the complete product during this phase. This phase is also known as Usability Testing. In usability testing, prototypes are evaluated and design flaws are determined during this phase. The prototypes build in the previous phase are tested by real users of the product. You will analyze users’ observations and interaction with prototypes — How do they feel using the product? How are they interacting with the prototype? Is the product fulfilling users’ goals? Then we make changes according to their feedback. However, testing is an iterative process and a non-linear process. Based on users’ feedback, the results are then used to redefine problems and you have to return to the previous four stages as per requirement.</p>

		  <p>Foundations of User Experience (UX) Design is the first of a series of seven courses that will equip you with the skills needed to apply to entry-level jobs in user experience design. UX designers focus on the interactions
        that people have with products like websites, mobile apps, and physical objects. UX designers make those everyday interactions usable, enjoyable, and accessible. The role of an entry-level UX designer might include
        empathizing with users, defining their pain points, coming up with ideas for design solutions, creating wireframes, prototypes, and mockups, and testing designs to get feedback. Current UX designers and researchers
        at Google will serve as your instructors, and you will complete hands-on activities that simulate real-world UX design scenarios. Learners who complete the seven courses in this certificate program should be equipped
        to apply for entry-level jobs as UX designers. </p>

      <h4>What a UX Career Looks Like Today</h4>
      <img src="download (1).png" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12" >
      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" > UX has emerged as a field in many more countries around the world. In our most recent study, we received responses from 65 different countries, compared to 38 countries in our original study. We also had a larger representation of non-English speaking countries, which could be an indicator of how the UX field has grown outside of the Western world over the 6-year period between studies.

        Our new report also analyzes the difference between UX roles, particularly between researchers, designers, and generalists. Although specialization is not new to the field, we had not performed this analysis in 2013. Some highlights of the differences between researchers and designers are given below.
        
        The Designer Role in a Snapshot
        Those with a UX designer role often have a broad range of responsibilities: from designing prototypes to collaborating with subject-matter experts or carrying out qualitative usability tests. Designers tend to have a design-related education and have skills in using prototyping tools and performing visual design. Many have front-end–coding skills.</p>

     <img src="download.png" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12" >
     <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >It’s no longer enough to have a useful product that solves the user’s problem. Now, and in the years to come, user’s are expecting more. The products they use should be just useful as well as easy to interact with, engaging, and visually appealing. Motion design is a great way to keep users hooked and make their experiences frictionless.

      Filling blank spaces with relevant animations and lively transitions are a great way to appeal to the user’s emotions, keep them engaged, and make their experiences feel smooth and seamless.
      
      Users are also relying on mobile devices on a more regular basis. They expect to be able to achieve everything they would be able to on a website on a smartphone or tablet. Smaller devices means less screen real estate.
      
      This is where utilizing gestures (like swiping, pinching, tapping, or tilting the screen) is key. Designing intuitive gestural interfaces allows more content to be stored within an app without overcrowding the screen and overwhelming the user.</p>
